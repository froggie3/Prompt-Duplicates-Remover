## What is this?

A handy tool that can eliminate any duplicated tokens in your prompt:

We engineer prompts in generating images with Stable Diffusion where you combine words and phrases. However, it sometimes makes us struggled since the more words we deel with the harder we manage all of them, for example, it is not rare for us to allow the prompt to have duplicated words. The tool enables it more easier, and sanitizes, and deletes any duplicated words in a prompt.

## How to use

Paste your prompt into the textarea laveled with “Paste your prompt here“ when the tool parses the prompt at once, gets rid of the redundant words, and then displays the result. You can select the output text and copy into the clipboard to use it for generating images you like.

The section below have “Reduced prompts“ and “Total prompts removed“ each. “Reduced prompts“ is a brief summary for the deleted words, while “Total prompts removed“ refers to the total number of tokens deleted.

      The checkbox provides two options to optimize the prompt input. “remove breaks“ just eliminates unwanted breaks in a prompt and “add space before comma“ places a comma after spaces. As you mark the checkbox, a button appears next to the checkbox.
